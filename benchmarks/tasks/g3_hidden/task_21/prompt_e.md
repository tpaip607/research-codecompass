You are working on the FastAPI RealWorld example app at /Users/tarak/engineer/repos/fastapi-realworld-example-app.

Task: Add an optional cache=False parameter to the get_repository() function signature in app/api/dependencies/database.py. Ensure every call site that uses get_repository() is updated to include the explicit parameter. The function behavior does not need to change — only the signature and all call sites must be updated.

IMPORTANT: Before editing any file, run this command to discover structural dependencies:

    codecompass neighbors <file_path>

This shows all files that import or instantiate the target file.
Read every file returned by this command before making edits.

The most commonly missed files are dependency injection factories.
