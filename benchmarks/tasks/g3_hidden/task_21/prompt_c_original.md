You are working on the FastAPI RealWorld example app at /Users/tarak/engineer/repos/fastapi-realworld-example-app.

Task: Add an optional cache=False parameter to the get_repository() function signature in app/api/dependencies/database.py. Ensure every call site that uses get_repository() is updated to include the explicit parameter. The function behavior does not need to change — only the signature and all call sites must be updated.

Do NOT use the Task tool. Your very first tool call must be get_architectural_context(file_path="app/api/dependencies/database.py"). After receiving the results, you MUST read every file listed in the output before making any edits — even files that may not need modification. Only after reading all neighbors should you decide which files to edit.
