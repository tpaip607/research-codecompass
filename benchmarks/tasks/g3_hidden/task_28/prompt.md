You are working on the FastAPI RealWorld example app at /Users/tarak/engineer/repos/fastapi-realworld-example-app.

Task: Change the article slug generation in app/services/articles.py to add a "conduit-" prefix to every generated slug. Update all places in the codebase that create, store, or query articles by slug to account for this change. Ensure existing tests are updated to use the new slug format.
