You are working on the FastAPI RealWorld example app at /Users/tarak/engineer/repos/fastapi-realworld-example-app.

Task: Change the API response envelope format from using the resource name as the key (e.g., {"user": {...}}) to always using "data" as the key (e.g., {"data": {...}}). Update all response schema classes, all route handlers that return these schemas, and all tests that assert on the response structure.
