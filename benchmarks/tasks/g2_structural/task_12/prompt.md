You are working on the FastAPI RealWorld example app at /Users/tarak/engineer/repos/fastapi-realworld-example-app.

Task: Create a new module app/api/validators.py that centralizes pagination constants (DEFAULT_ARTICLES_LIMIT, DEFAULT_ARTICLES_OFFSET). Move these constants from app/models/schemas/articles.py into this new module. Update all files that currently reference these constants to import them from the new location.
